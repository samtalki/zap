**Zap**  is a Python library for for differentiable electricity system modeling.
It provides a modular, component-based approach to building electricity models.
Models can be solved using a GPU-accelerated ADMM solver, integrated into PyTorch-based deep learning models, or iteratively planned using gradient algorithms.
